**Problem 1** This problem uses the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset, available
as an Excel file on the course website.

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows
with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in
read\_excel use reasonable variable names omit rows that do not include
dumpster-specific data round the number of sports balls to the nearest
integer

``` r
trash_wheel_df = read_excel("./data_hw2/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx")
```

    ## New names:
    ## * `` -> ...15
    ## * `` -> ...16
    ## * `` -> ...17

``` r
trash_wheel_df = janitor::clean_names(trash_wheel_df)
trash_wheel_df = drop_na(trash_wheel_df, dumpster)
trash_wheel_df = select(trash_wheel_df, !starts_with("x"))#omit columns containing notes
rounding_sports_balls = round(trash_wheel_df$sports_balls,digit = 0)
trash_wheel_df = transform(trash_wheel_df, sports_balls = rounding_sports_balls)
```

Read and clean precipitation data for 2018 and 2019. For each, omit rows
without precipitation data and add a variable for year. Next, combine
precipitation datasets and convert month to a character variable (the
variable month.name is built into R and should be useful).

``` r
precipitation_df = filter(trash_wheel_df, year %in% c("2018","2019"))
precipitation_df = select(precipitation_df, year,weight_tons:homes_powered)
```

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in both resulting datasets,
and give examples of key variables. For available data, what was the
total precipitation in 2018? What was the median number of sports balls
in a dumpster in 2017?
